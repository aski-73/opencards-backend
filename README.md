# Readme

This is the core of the OpenCards flash card app. It contains all main services to transform a (somewhat) well-defined
text file to a format complying to a meta model in order to implement a graphical layer upon it.

## Usage

Build with gradle

```./gradlew build``` (fails currently. Use via IntelliJ IDEA)

## TODO

- Define a meta model (class diagram and kotlin source)
- JSON output
